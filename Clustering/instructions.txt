Find a dataset suitable for clustering and use Orange, Weka, or IPython Notebook to find a good set of clusters. 
Try using various kinds of methods and metrics, and compare the outcomes. 
Compute descriptive statistics for each cluster and visualize the results. 
Attempt to provide labels for each cluster that would fit the instances you likely to find in that cluster. 
Describe the data, methodology, and results in a formal technical report. 
Make sure to include figures and tables that describe the process and the outcomes, and reference them from the text. 
Submit your report using a PDF format.
